# cell-culture-bioprocess-optimization

##Project Overview
This proyect explores how data analysis can be used to undestand and optimize cell culture bioprocess using key metabolic indicators.
The focus is on process monitoring and performance improvement, not clinical diagnosis.

## Objetives
- Analyze process-related variables in cell culture systems
- Explore metabolic indicators such as glucose, lactate, glutamine, and viability
- Extract insights relevant for bioprocess optimization

##Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn

##Project Status 
In progress
